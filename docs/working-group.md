# ðŸ“¦ Open Data Packaging Working Group

Say you discover an interesting dataset online and you want to use it in a project. You need to download the dataset files, process them, read them, and then, upload them to your GitHub/database/S3 bucket/...

Say you've built a nice dataset by hand and want to make it accessible to the world. You go and upload the files to your GitHub/database/S3 bucket/sheet/...

**What if there was a better way to share and consume open datasets?**

There is, and we can make it work together.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

Check out the [Quickstart Notebook](../notebooks/quickstart.ipynb) to see how to package any dataset online with existing tooling.
