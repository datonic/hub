## Why Frictionless?

Frictionless Specs define a lightweight abstraction layer on top of data files to make them easier to use. Adhering to a standard like Frictionless makes it easier to share data, build tools, and create a more open data ecosystem. Another benefit of using Frictionless is that it allows you to package external datasets in a permissionless way.
