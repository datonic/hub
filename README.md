## 🌟 Principles

- [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
- Minimal and flexible. Rely on tools that do one thing and do it well.
- No vendor lock-in.
  - Rely on Open code, standards, and infrastructure.
  - Use the tool you want to create, explore, and consume the datasets.
- Modular ecosystem. Rely on standards like Arrow for IPC, and Frictionless for metadata.
- Distributed Permissionless ecosystem and collaboration. Open source code and make it ready to be improved.
- Declarative and reproducible workflows and datasets. Everything as code.
- Open and transparent governance and funding.
- Embrace inmutability and idempotency. Rely on content-addressable storage and append-only logs.
- Aim for stateless and serverless deployments. E.g. use GitHub Pages, host datasets on S3.
- Offline-first. Rely on static files and offline-first tools like [Datasette](https://datasette.io/).
