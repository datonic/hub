# 📦 Datonic Hub

The center of the Datonic community.

Our goal is to improve coordination and shared understanding by exploring how the world produces **open data** with **open source software** using **open protocols** running on **open infrastructure**.

## 🌟 Principles

These are some of the guiding principles we, as a community, should keep in mind.

- [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
- Minimal (KISS) and flexible. Rely on tools that do one thing and do it well.
- No vendor lock-in.
  - Rely on Open code, standards, and infrastructure.
  - Use the tool you want to create, explore, and consume the datasets. Agnostic of any tooling or infrastructure provider.
  - Standard format for data and APIs! [Keep your data as future-friendly and future-proof as possible](https://indieweb.org/longevity)! E.g: [publish data as Parquet files on S3](https://www.robinlinacre.com/parquet_api/).
- Data Sovereignty. Data is yours, open standards, locally runnable, reproducible.
- Modular ecosystem. Rely on standards like Arrow for IPC, and Frictionless for metadata.
- Distributed Permissionless ecosystem and collaboration. Open source code and make it ready to be improved.
  - Data marketplace not linked to a specific company or platform.
- Declarative and reproducible workflows and datasets. Everything as code.
- Focus on Data Products and not just datasets.
  - E.g: Datadex produces a dashboard and puts the data where people can find and use it.
- Open and transparent governance and funding.
- Untap the potential of existing open data and modern tooling.
- Community that incentives contributors.
- Non Profit / Cooperative / Community-owned.
- Embrace inmutability and idempotency. Rely on content-addressable storage and append-only logs.
- Aim for stateless and serverless deployments. E.g. use GitHub Pages, host datasets on S3.
- Offline-first. Rely on static files and offline-first tools like [Datasette](https://datasette.io/).
- Aim for stateless and serverless deployments. E.g. use GitHub Pages, host datasets on S3. No servers to maintain, no databases to manage, no infrastructure to worry about. Keep infrastructure management lean. Dumb servers with self-verification.
- Reuse existing tools.
- Act local and start small. Focus on one community at a time and solve the problems great at that scale.
- Build tools to make using the right standard (on your community), the easiest and best option. Dont aim for an universal Standard or Protocol.
- Experiment mindset. Encourage trying new things (tools, processes, frameworks, ...).
- [Above all, have fun and ejoy the process](https://indieweb.org/principles). 🎉
